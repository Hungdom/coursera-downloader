Coursera Downloader
==================
version: 2.1
license: GPLv3

This is a python script to download coursera lecture videos and files.

coursera.py has cool features:
    * rewritten with a class structure
    * saves cookies
    * shows download progress
    * can provide multiple coursenames at once

get.py is the original script, I have decided to keep it while I test out coursera.py.

Requirements:
    Python 2.6          (http://python.org/download)
    Beautiful Soup 4    (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup)

First edit the config.py file:
    username
    password
    files to download: mp4, srt, txt, pdf, pptx
    foldermapping: if you want the name of folder different from the coursename
    downloadpath: files are downloaded to current directory by default

To start downloading, execute in a terminal:
    python coursera.py <coursename1> [<coursename2> <coursename3> ...]

Coursename can be determined from the url of the course.
eg: https://class.coursera.org/ml-2012-002/lecture/index
To download lectures of ml class, execute:
    python coursera.py ml-2012-002

Multiple courses can be supplied at once:
    python coursera.py ml-2012-002 crypto-2012-003 algs4partI-2012-001

Limitations:
    * Initially it will download all the lectures from the beginning. To download selected lectures, hack the coursera.py script
    * It does not resume incomplete downloads.
