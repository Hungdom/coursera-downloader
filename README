Coursera Downloader
==================

This is a python script to download coursera lecture videos and files.

coursera.py is the latest and greatest
    * rewritten with class structure
    * saves cookies
    * shows download progress

get.py is the original script, has been kept until the new script is fully tested.

Requirements:
    python 2.6
    beautifulsoup 4

First edit the config.py file:
    username
    password
    files to download: mp4, srt, txt, pdf, pptx
    foldermapping: if you want the name of folder different from the coursename
    downloadpath: default is current directory

To start the download, execute in a terminal:
    python coursera.py <coursename>

Coursename can be determined from the url of the course.
eg: https://class.coursera.org/ml-2012-002/lecture/index
To download lectures of ml class, execute:
    python coursera.py ml-2012-002

Limitations:
    * Initially it will download all the lectures from the beginning. To download selected lectures, hack the coursera.py script
    * It does not resume incomplete downloads.
